# <img src="https://github.com/tgbnhy/torch-trajectory/blob/developing/t4.png" alt="drawing" width="60"/>  T-Torch: searching trajectories in a fast way
* T-Torch is the world's first search engine for trajectory data, which is built over our research paper below:
```
Sheng Wang, Zhifeng Bao, J. Shane Culpepper, Zizhe Xie, Qizhi Liu, Xiaolin Qin: Torch: A Search Engine for 
Trajectory Data. SIGIR 2018: 535-544
```
* We also have a traffic analytics system based on T-Torch: http://47.75.79.142:8080/TTorchServer/.

## Supported queries 
T-Torch is able to efficiently answer two typical types of queries now:
* Boolean search
  * Range query
  * Path query
  * Strict path query
* Top-k similarity search, we support a list of similarity measures:
  * Dynamic time wrapping (DTW)
  * Longest common sub-sequence (LCSS)
  * Edit distance with real penalty (EDR)
  * Hausdorff distance
  * Discrete Fr√©chet Distance
  * Longest overlapped road segments (LORS)

## Features of framework
* T-Torch performs trajectory search over the mapped trajectories.
  * Optimized map-matching algorithms over Graphhopper
  * Ligtweight data storage
* Fast search with
  * Compressiable index
  * Various similarity measures
* Trajectory visualization on real road network

## Getting started
### 0. Download the Porto Dataset
Our trajectory dataset collected at Porto is available. 
The dataset is map-matched and indexed. 
Please download it at https://drive.google.com/open?id=110U9RaQxHxWS_tN0IjI-A1N71ElRiyBM
and put it in the root directory of the project.

### 1. Dependencies
We manage the dependent libraries with Maven. You can easily install those 
required softwares in pom.xml file.

### 2. Running the sample program
We provide a use case for Path query. The main() method is in the 
Test class.

```
   1. Engine engine = Engine.getBuilder().build();
   2. List<List<TrajEntry>> queries = read();
   3. QueryResult result = engine.findOnPath(queries.get(0));
``` 

T-Torch provides high level class *Engine* containing simple APIs for query processing. 
- line 1 loads/builds the index structures of a dataset, encapsulated by Engine class.
- line 2 loads sample queries provided by us.
- line 3 invokes API of a path query. APIs for other supported query types are described in the next section

### 3. Query Types

#### 1) Range query
```
   QueryResult ret = engine.findInRange(50, 50, 50);
```
The range query is used to retrieve trajectories passing through a specified rectangular area. To define the rectangular area, three arguments are needed. 
Latitude and longitude defines the middle point, with radius( in meters) together representing the rectangular area.

#### 2) Path query
```
   QueryResult ret = engine.findOnPath(query);
```
The Path query<sup>[2]</sup> is used to retrieve trajectories having at least one common edge with the query.
The argument it takes is a "path" represented by a list of *Coordinate*.

#### 3) Strict path query
```
   QueryResult ret = engine.findOnStrictPath(query)
```
The strict path query<sup>[2]</sup> is used to retrieve trajectories strictly passing through the entire query from beginning to end.
The argument it takes is a "path" represented by a list of *Coordinate*.

#### 4) Top-k trajectory similarity search
```
   QueryResult ret = engine.findTopK(query, 3);
```
The top-k query returns
k highest ranked trajectories based on the specified similarity measure.
First argument is a "query trajectory" represented by a list of *Coordinate*, 
and the second is number of top results to return.

### 4. QueryResult
```
   if (ret.mappingSucceed){
      List<Trajectory<TrajEntry>> l = ret.getResultTrajectory();
      String mapVformat = ret.getMapVFormat();
   }else{
       //do something
   }
```

After the query is processed, object of type QueryResult is returned uniformly. 
It contains the query trajectory in raw form, the map-matched query trajectory, and all trajectories being retrieved. Also, you can project these on MapV<sup>[3]</sup> for visualization purpose.

### 3. Use your own dataset
If you want to search over your own dataset, please follow these steps for data preprocessing:

1) Download the map data from openstreetmap where the trajectory data is collected,
It should be in *.osm.pbf format and you need to put it into Resourses directory.

2) Preprocess your dataset into the format supported by our program. 
Map matching is the technique for projecting raw trajectories onto real road network.
The first argument is the URI of raw trajectory data-set, while the second argument 
**"Resources/porto.osm.pbf"** should be the URI to your PBF file<sup>[1]</sup>
After setup, call start() method to convert raw trajectories to mapped trajectories.
After mapmatching, run the main() program in the Torch.base.db.DBManager class to build inverted index on disk. 
Please take our Porto dataset as an example. 
```
   MapMatching mm = MapMatching.getBuilder().build("Resources/porto_raw_trajectory.txt","Resources/porto.osm.pbf");
   mm.start();
```


#### Note:
```
   trajectoryID [[latitude1,longtitude1],[latitude2,longtitude2],...]
```
 1. The format of trajectory data should be the same as it in sample data-set, and there is a **\t** character separating trajectory id and content of it
 2. If using your own dataset, please preprocess your data properly. Low quality trajectories leads to low projection rate, and high length trajectories (over 200) could affect query time.
